  "trend_summary": "Over the period the landscape stays overwhelmingly agricultural. Cropland consolidates into larger rectangular parcels, replacing scattered woodland and pasture, particularly north-central and near the looping river. A modestly denser road grid and a few new farmsteads appear, yet settlements remain tiny. Forested hills in the south endure with little disturbance.",
