  "trend_summary": "2000-2023 imagery shows a compact CBD surrounded by parks. Vacant lots and low-rise blocks are steadily replaced by denser mixed-use buildings, especially along the main north-south avenue. Transport capacity rises with a widened freeway and new light-rail/road corridor, while airport infrastructure grows. Simultaneously, riverside green space is rehabilitated, adding canopy and wetlands.",
