  "trend_summary": "Across the series, built-up land gradually enlarges yet stays interspersed with woodland. New warehouses and retail pads cluster near the southeastern highway knot, residential cul-de-sacs infill interior blocks, and main roads gain extra lanes and ramps. Some riverside factories are replaced with lighter commercial uses and green buffers. Overall character: medium-density, automobile-oriented suburbia.",
