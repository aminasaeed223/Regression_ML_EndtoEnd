  "trend_summary": "1990s–2020s imagery shows largely forest- and field-dominated countryside. Small pockets of housing and farm structures expanded slowly along main roads, with minor infill and a few new cul-de-sacs. Some cropland reverted to woodland, and scattered clear-cuts appear. Road network remains stable; no major industrial or commercial hubs emerge. Overall character stays rural and sparsely built.",
