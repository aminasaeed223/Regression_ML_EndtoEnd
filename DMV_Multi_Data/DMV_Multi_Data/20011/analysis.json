  "trend_summary": "Built-up coverage grows moderately through the series: downtown’s gridded core stays intact while fringe neighbourhoods fill in and industrial land expands eastward. A new highway/arterial spine appears, spurring commercial strips and airport-side logistics growth. Tree cover increases inside the grid via parks and street greening, yet peripheral forest largely persists, keeping overall density medium.",

    "Noticeable infill and redevelopment within the central grid, reducing vacant lots.",
    "Enhanced urban greenery: larger park footprints and more tree canopy along streets."
