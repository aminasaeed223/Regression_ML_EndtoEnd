  "trend_summary": "Built-up footprint expanded steadily via infill estates and light-industrial parks, especially south-east and central corridors. Major road interchange upgrades boosted connectivity. While large forest blocks persist, edge woodland shrank and was replaced by housing, schools and sports fields. Tree planting within existing estates slightly offset overall greenery loss.",
