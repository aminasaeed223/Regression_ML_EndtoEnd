  "trend_summary": "Across the series, the suburb keeps its grid, but infill and commercial redevelopment slowly raise built-up cover. A widened freeway and new ramps appear south-east, while the diagonal retail corridor gains larger roofs and parking reconfiguration. Tree canopy thickens and small parks emerge, balancing moderate growth so density stays medium suburban.",
