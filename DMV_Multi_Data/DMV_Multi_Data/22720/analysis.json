  "trend_summary": "Across the series, forested tracts slowly give way to patchy cropland and scattered dwellings. A new diagonal highway and several feeder roads appear, stimulating ribbon development but no true town centers. Small clearings enlarge into contiguous fields, while southern woodlots thin. Overall character stays sparsely built and overwhelmingly rural.",
