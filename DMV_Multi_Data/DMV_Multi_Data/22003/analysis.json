  "trend_summary": "Across the image sequence, low-rise residential fabric thickens, commercial strips widen along the highway spine, and several wooded tracts convert to cul-de-sac housing. Minor greening projects appear in park blocks, but impervious cover slowly expands, especially near the central interchange. Overall, suburban sprawl with steady infill, not high-rise urbanisation, dominates the period.",
