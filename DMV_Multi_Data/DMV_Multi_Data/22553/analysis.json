  "trend_summary": "Forested terrain is gradually opened for agriculture, quarrying and dispersed housing. Built-up footprint grows slowly but remains scattered along new and widened roads, while forest cover shrinks, especially centrally. A quarry enlarges and several curvilinear subdivisions appear near the southeast. The landscape stays predominantly rural with sparse overall density.",
