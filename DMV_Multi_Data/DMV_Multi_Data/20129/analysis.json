  "trend_summary": "Across the series the landscape stays dominantly pastoral-wooded. Only scattered new houses and sheds appear along county roads, chiefly near the southwest village, lifting built-up cover slightly yet still sparse. Some pasture blocks are enlarged, a few woodlots cleared or allowed to regrow, and minor road realignments occur; no major industrial or commercial growth.",
