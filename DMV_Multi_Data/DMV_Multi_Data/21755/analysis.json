  "trend_summary": "Across the five time-steps, a predominantly agricultural landscape shows slight urban growth along the central east-west corridor. Field boundaries become larger and more regular, while forest patches shift marginally southward. Built-up footprints expand modestly near the main road, yet open land still dominates, keeping overall character rural and low-density.",

    "Gradual infill and outward spread of the small town along the central east–west road.",
    "Emergence of a few roadside industrial/commercial structures east of the town core.",
    "Agricultural parcels consolidate, creating larger, more uniform fields, especially in the northwest.",
    "Minor reduction and relocation of forest patches along the southern margin.",
    "Improved transport line: clearer, possibly widened highway cutting across the middle of the area."
