  "trend_summary": "Across the time series, low-rise development edges outward from existing streets. Commercial pads expand along the highway, while several wooded lots convert to cul-de-sac housing. New storm-water ponds and parking areas appear, trimming forest cover. Roads widen but no tower blocks arise, leaving a green, medium-density suburban landscape overall.",
