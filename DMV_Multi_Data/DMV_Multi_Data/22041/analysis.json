  "trend_summary": "From earliest to latest imagery, tree-dominated suburbs persist while incremental infill thickens housing grids. The eastern industrial/commercial zone expands with new white-roof warehouses and larger parking lots. A central arterial corridor is widened and commercial frontage intensifies. Reservoir water levels fluctuate but shoreline stabilisation appears after mid-period. Overall change is gradual suburban consolidation rather than wholesale urbanisation.",

    "Addition of several large white-roof warehouses and loading yards in the eastern industrial district.",
    "Progressive widening and resurfacing of the main east–west arterial road, with more commercial lots along it.",
    "Residential infill: new cul-de-sacs and houses occupy former wooded plots in multiple neighbourhood pockets.",
    "Reservoir/waterbody shows fluctuating extent early on, followed by construction of steadier embankments and darker water tone.",
    "Slight overall increase in tree canopy despite development, suggesting concurrent greening or replanting projects."
