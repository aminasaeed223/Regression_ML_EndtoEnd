  "trend_summary": "Forest gives way to more cropland at the northern tongue and south-east, while a central quarry/industrial pad grows, peaks, then starts revegetating. Built structures add slowly along the main road, but the airstrip stays constant. Net result is slightly higher human footprint yet still a sparsely settled rural landscape.",

    "Central light-tan quarry/industrial platform enlarges through mid-series, then shows partial closure and vegetation return in the latest view.",
    "Agricultural fields expand northward and south-east, fragmenting contiguous forest cover.",
    "Minor increase in scattered farm or residential buildings along the main southwest–northeast roadway.",
    "Runway and aviation facilities remain stable, indicating continued but unchanging airfield use."
