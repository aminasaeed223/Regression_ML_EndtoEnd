  "trend_summary": "Built-up footprint progressively expanded, especially in the north-west and along the main spine road, converting fields and scattered woodland into housing and small industrial lots. Road density rose and roundabouts appeared, while most southern forest stayed intact. Overall change shows steady suburbanisation from a mostly rural mosaic to a medium-density settlement.",
