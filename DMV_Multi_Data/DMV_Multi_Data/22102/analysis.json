  "trend_summary": "Across the series the wooded, low-rise suburb maintains its character while the southern highway junction catalyses growth: office parks and large white-roofed warehouses spread outward, a few new cul-de-sac housing pockets appear, and forest edges recede slightly. Road widening and added ramps accompany this commercial expansion; otherwise the mainly tree-covered residential fabric stays stable.",
