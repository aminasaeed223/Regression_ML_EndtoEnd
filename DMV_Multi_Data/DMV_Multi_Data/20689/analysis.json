  "trend_summary": "From earliest to latest imagery, the mostly wooded, farmland-dominated area remains low-density. Scattered new houses cluster along the north-west arterial and near crossroads, but forest still dominates. Some cropland in the south fluctuates, with patches reverting to woodland, while the eastern reservoir shoreline shifts. Road network sees minor upgrades, no heavy urbanisation.",
