  "trend_summary": "Landscape stays chiefly agricultural-forest mosaic. 2000s show more open cropland; later scenes display gradual infill by woodland, merged fields and a small east-central village edging outward. No major infrastructure appears, so built-up cover rises only marginally while green cover increases.",

    "Small residential cluster near the east-central crossroads expands by several blocks.",
    "Several peripheral fields in the northwest and centre revert to deciduous forest.",
    "Field consolidation: hedgerows/plots removed, creating larger rectangular parcels south-centre.",
    "A new farm track or minor road cuts diagonally through mid-sector cropland.",
    "Crop rotation patterns shift, visible as changing seasonal patchwork colours."
