  "trend_summary": "Built-up area grows steadily along the main highway: new cul-de-sac subdivisions and small commercial nodes appear, while tree cover recedes and open fields fragment. Despite expansion, structures remain low-rise and dispersed; no dense core forms. The landscape therefore evolves into a moderately intensified, car-oriented suburban belt with gradual outward growth.",
