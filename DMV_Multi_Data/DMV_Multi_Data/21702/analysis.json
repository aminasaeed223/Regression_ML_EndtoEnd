  "trend_summary": "Built-up zones in the south-east expand gradually, nibbling at adjoining fields and creating new housing pockets. Farmland remains dominant in the east, while dense woodland in the west stays largely intact. Overall, growth is steady but not explosive, with incremental road and estate infill rather than large industrial sprawl.",
