  "trend_summary": "Across the series the landscape stays dominantly forest-and-field. Forest edges are gradually cut back and central cropland blocks widen, while only small clusters of farmsteads enlarge. A few new straight roads appear but no sizeable urban core forms. Overall character remains rural with sparse, dispersed buildings.",

    "Cropland blocks in the central corridor widen and merge, replacing forest patches.",

    "Minor infill around scattered farmsteads; building footprints grow slightly.",
    "New straight access road constructed linking southern clearings to the east.",
    "Localized regrowth/reforestation on western hills balances some earlier clearing."
