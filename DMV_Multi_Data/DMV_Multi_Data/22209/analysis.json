  "trend_summary": "Early frames show several large construction pits and parking lots within a compact campus core. Over time these gaps are filled by mid-rise blocks, and a secondary cluster grows eastward toward the bridge. Some parking is replaced by buildings or landscaped plazas, while the surrounding low-rise housing and riverside greenbelt stay stable. Net effect: moderate densification.",
