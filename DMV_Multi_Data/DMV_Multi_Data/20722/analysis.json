  "trend_summary": "Imagery reveals steady suburban infill: scattered vacant lots replaced by houses and commercial sheds, modest road extensions, expansion of a civic complex south. Parkland along the river remains but sports facilities are upgraded. Tree canopy and riparian vegetation thicken, offsetting slight build-up growth. Overall built form stays medium-density suburban with balanced green-to-roof ratio.",
