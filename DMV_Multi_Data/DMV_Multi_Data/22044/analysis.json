  "trend_summary": "Imagery shows steady suburban consolidation. The northern highway corridor gains big-box retail, wider roads and warehouses, while interior woodlots see scattered residential infill. Tree canopy declines slightly; south-side wetlands stay protected and get park upgrades. No high-rise growth: settlement intensifies yet remains mostly single-family, keeping a medium-density suburban character.",
