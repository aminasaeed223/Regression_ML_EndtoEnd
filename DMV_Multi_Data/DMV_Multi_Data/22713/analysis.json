  "trend_summary": "Land use remained overwhelmingly rural. Initial images show patchy forest clearance for farms; mid-period frames display modest forest recovery, then the latest scene exhibits widespread clear-cutting and bare soil in the northern uplands. Agricultural parcels consolidate and expand slightly, with minor road-side settlement growth, keeping built-up cover sparse overall.",

    "Minor extension of road corridors and scattered rural dwellings, but no significant urban nodes emerge."
