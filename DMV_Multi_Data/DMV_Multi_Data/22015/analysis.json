  "trend_summary": "Across the image series the road network stays fixed, but small‐scale infill and several new white-roofed commercial blocks appear near main arteries. Most cul-de-sac neighbourhoods remain unchanged while tree canopy noticeably thickens, filling gaps and edging roads. Overall built-up footprint rises only marginally, keeping a green, low-rise suburban character.",
