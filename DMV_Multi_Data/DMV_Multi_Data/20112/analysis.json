  "trend_summary": "Built-up footprint roughly doubled, with scattered pockets coalescing into larger suburban clusters along new and upgraded roads. Housing subdivisions radiate from the central spine, while forest and pasture shrink at edges. Industrial or commercial pads emerge near highway interchanges. Overall fabric stays green-dominated, but built form spreads steadily in all directions.",
