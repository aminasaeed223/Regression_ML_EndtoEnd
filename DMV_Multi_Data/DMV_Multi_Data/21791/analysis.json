  "trend_summary": "Across the sequence, the landscape remains mainly agricultural with scattered villages. The central quarry widens steadily, woodland shifts from slight gain to marked loss in the northeast, and field blocks are progressively consolidated. Only modest fringe growth of settlements occurs, keeping overall built-up presence low and rural character intact.",
