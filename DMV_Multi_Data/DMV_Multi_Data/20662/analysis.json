  "trend_summary": "Imagery shows a largely wooded peninsula gradually converted to agriculture. Early frames are dominated by dense forest with scattered clearings; successive scenes reveal expanding rectangular fields, thinner riparian belts and a slightly denser road web. Built-up footprints remain tiny, so the landscape evolves from forested to farm-mosaic while staying sparsely settled.",
