  "trend_summary": "Built-up area gradually radiates from the south-east core, transforming adjacent farmland into housing estates and light industry. New roads and roundabouts interlink growing hamlets. Woodland edges recede slightly, though small regrowth patches appear north-west. Despite expansion, fields and forest still dominate, giving a medium-density, suburban character overall.",
