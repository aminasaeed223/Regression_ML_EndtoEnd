  "trend_summary": "Built-up clusters, especially in the north-east, expand steadily, infilling farmland and edging into forest blocks. Road and runway infrastructure lengthens, while scattered rural hamlets densify along main corridors. Southern and western zones keep mainly agricultural, but show more field reconfiguration and clear-cuts. Overall, moderate suburbanisation replaces open land without reaching full urban continuity.",

    "Progressive enlargement of the airport/runway complex in the north-east quadrant.",

    "Widening and straightening of primary roads, with additional interchanges visible by final image.",
    "Forest clearance and conversion to larger, geometric fields in the south-east and west.",
    "Incremental infill of small villages into continuous built strips along arterial routes."
