  "trend_summary": "Across the sequence the landscape remains mainly agricultural and forested. Built-up strips along the central corridor lengthen only slightly, keeping overall settlement sparse. The northern limestone quarry enlarges markedly, while several peripheral fields convert to young woodland, increasing vegetative cover. Road and rail alignments persist with minor widening, indicating light rural growth without urbanisation.",
