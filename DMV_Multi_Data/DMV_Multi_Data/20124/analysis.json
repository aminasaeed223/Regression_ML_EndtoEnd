  "trend_summary": "From the earliest scene to the latest, low-density housing pushes south-east from the northwest subdivision, following the diagonal highway. Forest is gradually cleared for scattered lots, lawns and small fields, shrinking canopy but leaving large green blocks intact. No vertical or industrial growth appears; built form stays car-oriented, dispersed and overwhelmingly suburban.",

    "Northwest curvilinear subdivision extends with additional loops and cul-de-sacs.",
    "New driveways and minor roads branch off the diagonal highway, lengthening the road network.",
    "Numerous small forest clearings emerge across the centre and south for individual houses.",
    "Canopy cover declines moderately while grass/lawn surfaces increase near clearings.",
    "Shoreline outline remains stable with no major reservoir or wetland alteration."
