  "trend_summary": "Across the series, forested land is steadily converted to housing and civic uses. Cul-de-sac suburbs proliferate along the north–south corridor, while an oval stadium and a large central excavation emerge mid-period. Road capacity rises but high-rise footprints stay absent, so tree cover remains patchy. Built-up area grows roughly one-quarter, yielding a distinctly suburban, medium-density landscape.",

  "notable_changes": [
    "Oval athletics stadium constructed on the northern plateau between early and mid images.",
    "Large central clearing/quarry appears, expanding through mid-series before stabilising.",
    "Incremental residential infill edges existing cul-de-sac neighbourhoods, especially southeast.",
    "North–south arterial road widened and new junctions added, improving connectivity.",
    "Late-period images show modest canopy recovery on the southwest fringe, indicating greening or reclamation."
