  "trend_summary": "Built-up area steadily expands, led by the eastern industrial core and ribbon growth along main roads. Forest and farmland are incrementally cleared for warehouses, parking, and curvilinear housing tracts. Road density rises and a new southeast arterial appears, shifting the landscape from predominantly rural to a mixed, medium-density suburban setting.",
