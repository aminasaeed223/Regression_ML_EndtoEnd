  "trend_summary": "Built-up areas creep outward from the highway corridor and coastal node, filling gaps but staying compact. Quarry pits enlarge mid-period, then show partial revegetation. Southern wetland margins fluctuate, with later images displaying more open water. Forest cover is largely retained, so growth is steady rather than explosive, keeping an overall suburban, medium-density character.",
