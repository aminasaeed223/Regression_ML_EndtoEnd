  "trend_summary": "Core grid remained largely intact, with only scattered infill and rooftop redevelopments. River-edge parks were progressively landscaped, trails and pedestrian bridges added, and tree canopy expanded. Waterfront sediment and water levels varied through years but no major land reclamation occurred. Overall pattern stayed compact and built-up, with modest green and public-realm upgrades.",
