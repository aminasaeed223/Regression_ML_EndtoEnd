  "trend_summary": "Across the time-series the area remains largely rural. Small villages beside the main east-west road expand modestly, while scattered new houses and farm buildings dot surrounding fields. Forest cover oscillates—cleared for agriculture early on, then partly regenerating. Agricultural parcels grow and new minor roads appear, but no major urbanisation occurs.",
