  "trend_summary": "Built-up footprint grows slowly, mainly by housing infill and a new golf-course spine, while most land remains forest or fields. Farmland expands eastwards, some forest blocks fluctuate with small clear-cuts and regrowth. Coastline shows slight erosion and beach realignment, but no major hard infrastructure appears. Net change: modest growth, still low overall intensity.",

    "Southern beach edge retreats irregularly, indicating ongoing coastal erosion."
