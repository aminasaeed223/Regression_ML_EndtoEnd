  "trend_summary": "Across the time-series, built-up fabric slowly radiates from the north-west core and along the main highway, increasing roof density but retaining large forest blocks. New industrial roofs and interchange upgrades appear, several woodlots are cleared for housing or fields, yet the airfield and extensive green belt remain intact.",
