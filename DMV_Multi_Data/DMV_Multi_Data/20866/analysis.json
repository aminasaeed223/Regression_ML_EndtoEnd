  "trend_summary": "2000–2020 imagery shows steady suburban expansion. New housing subdivisions fill former fields east and south, commercial plazas cluster near the highway interchange, and infill increases along collector roads. Woodland edges remain largely intact, preserving a green belt. Overall built-up footprint expands moderately, raising density from sparse-medium to solid medium without forming a dense core.",
