  "trend_summary": "Across the series, the landscape stays farmland-dominated, yet the single town in the south slowly radiates new suburbs and light-industrial strips along the highway. Fields consolidate into larger blocks, while wooded cover increases on northern slopes and along riparian corridors. Shoreline recreation structures appear, but overall built-up density remains low.",
