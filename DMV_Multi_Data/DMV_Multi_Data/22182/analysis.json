  "trend_summary": "Across the series, the eastern core steadily enlarges, while scattered residential pockets infill along the central highway. Commercial/industrial footprints grow at the main interchange, yet extensive tree cover persists, so urbanisation is gradual rather than explosive. Overall built-up land modestly increases, indicating controlled suburban expansion with limited forest loss.",

  "notable_changes": [
    "Progressive enlargement of the southeastern built-up centre, with denser street grids and new blocks.",
    "Emergence of light-industrial/commercial buildings near the central highway interchange.",
    "Residential infill on former wooded lots along interior roads, reducing open canopy gaps.",
    "Construction or widening of feeder roads linking neighbourhoods to the highway.",
    "Minor forest clearing in western sector, balanced by some regrowth and preserved green corridors."
