  "trend_summary": "Built-up fabric gradually expands outward from the highway corridor, with scattered infill converting tree cover to housing and commercial blocks. Road network becomes denser, yet extensive woodland and lakes persist, keeping green cover dominant. Overall change reflects steady suburbanisation rather than dramatic urban sprawl.",
