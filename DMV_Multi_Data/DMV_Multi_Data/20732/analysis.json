  "trend_summary": "Built-up area grows gradually, mainly near the northern coast and along a new inland road. Forest is thinned by scattered clear-cuts and small farms, yet still dominates most of the peninsula. Shoreline morphology is stable with limited dune work. Overall pattern stays rural and low-density despite modest settlement infill.",
