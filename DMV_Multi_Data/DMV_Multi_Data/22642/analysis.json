  "trend_summary": "Over the time series, the corridor-villages remain small but farmland patches and clearings steadily enlarge, nibbling into surrounding forest. A modest expansion of housing clusters occurs west of the central roadway, yet most hills stay wooded. Overall built-up areas stay sparse and the landscape keeps a predominantly rural character with increasing agricultural footprint.",
