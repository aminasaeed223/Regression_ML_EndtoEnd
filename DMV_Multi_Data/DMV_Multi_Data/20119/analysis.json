  "trend_summary": "Across the image sequence the territory remains dominantly agricultural-rural. Built-up spots grow only marginally around scattered villages, while most change is in land cover: some fields consolidate, small forest blocks are cleared or re-planted, and a straighter road corridor appears. Overall settlement density stays sparse and no urban centres emerge.",
