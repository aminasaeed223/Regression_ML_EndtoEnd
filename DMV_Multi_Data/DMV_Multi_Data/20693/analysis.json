  "trend_summary": "Across the sequence, the landscape stays chiefly rural. Early scenes show extensive forest; mid-period images reveal forest clearing and cropland growth, followed by some reforestation. Built-up footprints enlarge only modestly along roads. A quarry expands and coastal wetlands shift south-east, but overall settlement remains sparse and dispersed.",

  "notable_changes": [
    "Forest cleared in central and southern zones, enlarging cropland between early and mid images.",
    "Small clusters of housing/farm structures infill along main road network, but no major urban core emerges.",
    "Quarry or open-pit mine in the south-east visibly expands over time.",
    "Pockets of reforestation appear in northern uplands after earlier clearing.",
    "Southern shoreline/wetland band shifts and widens, indicating erosion or restoration activity."
