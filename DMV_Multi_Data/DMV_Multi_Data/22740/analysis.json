  "trend_summary": "Mostly wooded hills progressively convert to a rural patchwork. Cropland broadens in valleys, forest fragments on central slopes, and a straight corridor road/line appears. Village footprints grow only slightly. The final scene shows widespread browning and canopy loss, likely from drought, fire or logging, confirming a gradual but limited human footprint in an overall sparse landscape.",
