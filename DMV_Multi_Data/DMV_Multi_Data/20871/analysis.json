  "trend_summary": "2000-2020 imagery shows a town spreading mainly south-eastward and along the north–south highway. Built-up footprints widen and infill, eating into fields, while surrounding forests stay largely intact. New roads and commercial parcels appear, raising overall urban footprint but leaving large green belts, so the landscape shifts from rural-fringe to clear suburbia.",
