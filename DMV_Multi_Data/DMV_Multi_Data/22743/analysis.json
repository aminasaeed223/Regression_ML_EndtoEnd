  "trend_summary": "Built-up villages stay small and scattered. 2000s–mid period show steady forest recovery, while the latest scene reveals marked canopy loss and browning over the northern highlands. Cultivated patches in the south-east expand slightly into former scrub. Road layout is stable; no major new infrastructure appears. Overall pattern remains predominantly natural and rural.",
