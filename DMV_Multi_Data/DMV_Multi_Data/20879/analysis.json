  "trend_summary": "Across the sequence, suburban fabric thickens: housing and mixed-use blocks fill gaps, industrial estates grow, and new roads knit the zones together. Forest and open land shrink, especially near the airport and western factories, though a small northern clearing re-greens later. Overall pattern remains suburban with medium, steadily rising built-up density.",
