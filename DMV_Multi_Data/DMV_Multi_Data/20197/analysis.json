  "trend_summary": "Across the time-series, the landscape stays overwhelmingly agricultural. Small clusters of farmsteads and scattered houses grow marginally, while several paddocks are either consolidated or replaced by young woodland blocks. Road traces and driveways multiply slightly, yet no large built-up core emerges. Overall change is slow and low-intensity, keeping the area largely rural and open.",
