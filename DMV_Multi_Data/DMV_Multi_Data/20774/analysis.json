  "trend_summary": "The territory evolves from dispersed housing amid large forest blocks to a noticeably fuller suburban mosaic. New subdivisions spread west-central and southeast, industrial roofs enlarge along the central highway, and several farmland parcels shrink. Tree cover declines slightly but pockets of reforestation appear north. Overall change indicates steady, moderate suburban growth without high-rise intensification.",
