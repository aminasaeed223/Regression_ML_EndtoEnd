  "trend_summary": "Between the earliest and latest scenes, cropland mosaics contract while forest cover steadily expands, signalling farmland abandonment. Low-density dwellings spread a little along the north-east highway and some new farm buildings emerge, yet no continuous urban fabric forms. Overall the landscape remains dominantly rural, with only marginal growth of dispersed housing.",
