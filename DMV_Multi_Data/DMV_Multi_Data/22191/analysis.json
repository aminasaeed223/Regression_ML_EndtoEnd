  "trend_summary": "Built-up area widened yearly, filling inner vacant plots and pushing east through land reclamation. New housing, light industry and roads tightened the fabric, while forests and wetlands retreated. Parks and water features appeared but could not offset lost green cover. The landscape evolved from semi-rural edges to a continuous, medium-density suburb.",
