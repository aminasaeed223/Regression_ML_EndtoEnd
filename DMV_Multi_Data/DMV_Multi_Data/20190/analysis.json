  "trend_summary": "2000-2020 imagery shows steady suburban infill. West-side office parks expanded block by block, replacing grass lots. Strip-commercial buildings and parking appeared along the highway. Central golf course and lakes stayed intact, while scattered forest eastward shrank slightly as new housing clusters emerged. Overall built surface rose moderately but green space still dominates.",
