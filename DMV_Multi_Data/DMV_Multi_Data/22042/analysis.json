  "trend_summary": "Built-up cover rises moderately from earliest to latest images, led by industrial growth near the highway cloverleaf and scattered commercial/residential infill along the main east-west arterial. Road infrastructure and parking areas widen, yet a substantial southern greenbelt persists and even gains canopy. The landscape remains predominantly suburban, with medium overall density.",
