  "trend_summary": "Across the series the landscape remains overwhelmingly agricultural with scattered farmsteads. The chief change is the creation of a mid‐reach reservoir, accompanied by modest field reconfiguration and small forest clearances. Housing grows only marginally along the main road, leaving built-up density sparse and the character firmly rural.",
