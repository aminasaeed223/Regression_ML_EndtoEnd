  "trend_summary": "Across the series the river-adjacent core adds several new blocks and parking decks, while scattered infill houses and small commercial pads appear along main roads. No large subdivisions form; street grid and tree canopy stay mostly intact. Overall the district matures from lightly built to fuller, but remains a medium-density suburban landscape.",
