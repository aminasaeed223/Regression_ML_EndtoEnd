  "trend_summary": "Across years, the gridded civic district stays intact. Infill construction enlarged two south-central parcels, parking lots converted to plazas, and several roofs gained solar panels. Tree canopy steadily thickened along streets and within the large eastern park, which added sports turf. Net result is slightly more built mass, yet greener, pedestrian-oriented public space.",
