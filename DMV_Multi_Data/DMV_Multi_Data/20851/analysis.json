  "trend_summary": "Over two decades, the suburban district remains largely intact: curvilinear residential streets stay constant while commercial and light-industrial strips at the southwest and southeast thicken with new large-roof roofs. Minor infill houses appear on scattered vacant lots. Public facilities expand in the northeast, and overall tree canopy grows, slightly increasing green cover without significant sprawl.",
