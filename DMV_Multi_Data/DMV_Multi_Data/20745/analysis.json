  "trend_summary": "Across the image series, suburban neighbourhoods gradually fill remaining forest and field pockets. Commercial blocks and large-roof warehouses cluster near the motorway interchange, while residential cul-de-sac tracts expand north-eastward. Green cover shrinks but some roadside tree belts persist. Road network stays fixed, acting as a spine for infill construction.",

  "notable_changes": [
    "Progressive conversion of farmland west of the interchange into residential lots and sports fields.",
    "Addition and enlargement of white-roof warehouse/retail buildings south and east of the cloverleaf.",
    "Substantial infill housing in northern neighbourhoods, tightening street grids and reducing open space patches.",
    "Tree cover loss along new subdivisions, though riparian and roadside green strips maintained.",
    "Parking-lot resurfacing and minor expansion around industrial estates, indicating intensified land use."
