  "trend_summary": "Across the series, built-up footprint grows mainly through infill and edge expansion, especially around the central spine and southeastern industrial blocks, while large parks and golf courses persist. Road network widens, new interchanges appear, and several brownfields convert to warehouses and housing, lifting overall impervious cover yet keeping substantial tree canopy.",

  "notable_changes": [
    "Progressive infill of vacant lots near the civic/commercial core, replacing bare soil with mid-rise buildings.",
    "Emergence and enlargement of industrial/warehouse clusters in the southeast quadrant.",
    "New highway interchange and lane additions along the western perimeter, increasing paved area.",
    "Residential subdivisions extend southward and northeastward, edging into former wooded land.",
    "Tree cover slightly rebounds in northern parklands, indicating managed greening despite growth."
