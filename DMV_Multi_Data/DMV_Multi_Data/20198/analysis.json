  "trend_summary": "Across the time-series the landscape remains dominantly agricultural–forestry mosaic. Farmland blocks slowly enlarge while forest patches shrink, especially around the central corridor, indicating ongoing clearance. A few small villages expand marginally along main roads, but built-up cover stays low. Infrastructure lines become clearer, hinting at minor road upgrades, with no major urbanisation.",

  "notable_changes": [
    "Progressive enlargement and consolidation of rectangular crop fields, particularly in central and northern sectors.",
    "Gradual reduction of contiguous forest, replaced by scattered paddocks and pasture.",
    "Slight expansion of village footprints near major junctions; new rooftops visible.",
    "Main east–west highway and connecting roads appear wider/straighter over time, suggesting upgrades.",
    "Seasonal imagery differences aside, no emergence of high-density urban cores or heavy industry."
