  "trend_summary": "1990s-style scattered houses evolved into wider, continuous ribbons of homes, especially south and east of the small airfield. Commercial blocks enlarged near the western highway junction, while several pasture plots shrank as cul-de-sac subdivisions appeared. Overall tree cover is largely stable and the runway persists, reflecting gradual suburban infill rather than rapid urbanisation.",
