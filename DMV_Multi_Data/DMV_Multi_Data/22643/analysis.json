  "trend_summary": "Throughout the sequence, the area remains predominantly rural. Central woodland persists, but peripheral tree cover is incrementally cleared, enlarging pastures and cropland. A handful of new farm buildings and access tracks emerge, yet no clustered urban growth appears. Land use therefore shifts toward slightly intensified agriculture without altering overall low-density character.",
