  "trend_summary": "2000-20xx imagery shows gradual suburban build-out. Forest and pasture in the south are cleared, first as construction sites, then a large school, stadium and parking appear. Residential cul-de-sacs extend westward and infill between existing estates, raising built-up coverage but green canopy still dominates. No high-rise or industrial growth.",
