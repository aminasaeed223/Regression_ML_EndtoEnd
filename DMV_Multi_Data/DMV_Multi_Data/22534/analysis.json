  "trend_summary": "1990–2020 imagery shows limited built-up growth. Small clusters of houses emerge along the east–west highway, yet built structures remain scattered. The dominant trend is farmland abandonment and progressive forest regrowth, shrinking light-toned fields. Minor new clearings and one quarry appear, balanced by overall greening. Road pattern is largely unchanged, confirming a stable, sparsely settled rural landscape.",
