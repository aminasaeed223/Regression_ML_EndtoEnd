  "trend_summary": "Across the time-series the corridor remains dominantly agricultural. Small villages in the centre and several junctions grow outward slightly, new farmsteads appear, and a few fields replace forest patches, but no large urban cores form. Transport lines are marginally upgraded. Overall land use stays rural with sparse, scattered construction.",
