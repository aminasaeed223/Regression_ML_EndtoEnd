  "trend_summary": "2000-sized civic grid stays intact; only incremental change occurs. Two parking/void lots are infilled, several roofs lighten or darken as they gain new membranes or solar panels, and tree canopy along avenues and parks thickens. Net footprint is nearly unchanged, but refurbishment and greening subtly intensify a dense urban core.",
