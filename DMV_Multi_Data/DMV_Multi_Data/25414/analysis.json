  "trend_summary": "Across the time-series, farmland remains dominant while villages slowly enlarge along the main northeast–southwest highway. Built-up footprints rise modestly, replacing scattered fields and edge woodlots, but no major urbanisation occurs. Field patterns shift, hinting at crop rotation and some woodland clearance in the southeast, balanced by small pockets of regrowth elsewhere.",
