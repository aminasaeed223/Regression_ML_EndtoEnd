  "trend_summary": "From earliest to latest imagery, the planned suburban settlement roughly doubles its built footprint through infill housing, expanded town-center retail and widened arterial roads. Forest cover contracts, especially around the northern highway corridor, while the central golf course remains largely intact. Change is steady and incremental, reflecting moderate growth.",
