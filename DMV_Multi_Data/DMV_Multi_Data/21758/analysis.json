  "trend_summary": "Agriculture expands eastward as fields consolidate, while western uplands slowly reforest. Built surfaces change little: only modest village infill and a widened riverside road appear. Patchy crop rotation drives most spectral variation. Overall, the area remains sparsely built and distinctly rural throughout the time series.",
