  "trend_summary": "Across the image sequence, the mature suburb remains largely intact; growth occurs mainly through small-parcel infill and a few new subdivisions at the fringe. Commercial blocks densify, roads stay fixed, and tree canopy gradually thickens, giving a greener appearance. Large park/golf and riverside greenbelt persist with little alteration.",
