  "trend_summary": "Across the time-series, forest remains dominant while scattered farmsteads and small hamlets expand slightly along the north–south highway. Agricultural clearings enlarge at the western and southeastern edges, balanced by patches of woodland regrowth elsewhere. Overall built-up footprint grows slowly, keeping the landscape predominantly rural and low-density.",
