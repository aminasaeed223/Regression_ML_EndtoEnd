  "trend_summary": "Built-up surfaces grow steadily from scattered settlements to a modest town core with satellite housing, while most of the territory remains cropland and woodland. New industrial clusters appear beside the main highway and a bypass ring. Some marginal fields revert to forest, so impervious cover rises moderately but landscape still reads mainly rural.",

    "Town centre footprint expands and coalesces with nearby villages, roughly doubling residential area.",
    "Industrial/warehouse complex emerges on eastern edge beside primary road after mid-series.",
    "New bypass or ring-road constructed, increasing road density around central settlement.",
    "Several former cropland patches in the south and west show progressive reforestation or pasture abandonment.",
    "Small housing estates infill along the north-west corridor, converting field blocks into low-density suburbia."
