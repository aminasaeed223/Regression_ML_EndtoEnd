  "trend_summary": "Imagery shows a predominantly rural mosaic shifting between forest and cropland. Early frames have mixed woodland and small fields; mid-period clearing enlarges pale crop blocks, followed by partial forest regrowth, and ending with renewed cultivation. Built fabric remains minimal, limited to a linear road corridor and scattered farmsteads.",

    "Progressive enlargement of central and eastern crop fields, replacing woodland.",

    "Minor infill of farmsteads along the transport line; no major urban nuclei.",
    "Field boundaries consolidate over time, indicating mechanised agriculture adoption."
