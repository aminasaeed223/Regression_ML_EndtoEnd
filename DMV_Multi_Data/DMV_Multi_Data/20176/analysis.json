  "trend_summary": "2000-2022 imagery shows modest urban creep from the coastal city into adjacent farmland, while most of the territory remains agricultural and wooded. Built-up footprint rises slowly, road network densifies, villages enlarge, yet forest cover on western hills recovers slightly. Overall density stays sparse and the landscape remains predominantly rural.",
