  "trend_summary": "2000s imagery shows isolated subdivisions mainly in the south. Through the 2010s-2020s, housing estates sprawl northward along the highway, roads thicken, and scattered lots infill. Farmland and forest still dominate the north, so growth is moderate, not transformative.",
  "keywords": ["Medium density", "Suburban", "Subdivisions", "Farmland", "Highway"],
  "notable_changes": [
    "Progressive expansion of residential subdivisions south-central to mid-sector, especially west of the main highway.",
    "New commercial/industrial footprints beside the southern highway interchange by the latest image.",
    "Infill housing and denser street grid within earlier subdivisions, reducing open patches.",
    "Clearing of small woodland pockets in the central corridor for development or agriculture.",
    "Minor road extensions and roundabouts added, improving connectivity between old and new neighborhoods."
