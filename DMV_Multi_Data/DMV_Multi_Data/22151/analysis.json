  "trend_summary": "Imagery shows gradual suburban consolidation. Small forest clearings fill with detached-house subdivisions, mainly southwest and mid-corridor. The eastern industrial/airport zone gains extra warehouses and paved yards. Highway alignment stays, but junctions and one roundabout are upgraded. Despite these additions, broad woodland belts, ponds and wetlands are largely retained, so growth is moderate.",
