  "trend_summary": "Across the image set, settlement remains limited to scattered hamlets; no sizable town emerges. The most visible evolution is land-cover: forest in the north and west is progressively thinned, while rectangular pasture and crop fields spread eastward and into the central valley. Road traces sharpen slightly, but built-up footprint stays tiny and discontinuous.",
