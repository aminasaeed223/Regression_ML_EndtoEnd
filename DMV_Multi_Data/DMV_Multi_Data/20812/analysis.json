  "trend_summary": "2000-2023 imagery shows a stable, wooded lakeside suburb. Housing remains low-rise; only slight roadside infill and one new cul-de-sac enlarge the built footprint. Forest still dominates, though pockets of shoreline clearing appear. Lake colour fluctuates markedly—clear, vegetated, then turbid—indicating episodic hydrological change rather than lasting land-use shifts.",

    "2–3 new detached houses added along the main east–west road after mid-series.",
    "Small cul-de-sac built at the southeast edge, extending residential reach into former woodland.",
    "Selective tree removal and soil exposure near the northern shoreline.",
    "Lake surface alternates from vegetated/clear to brown, high-sediment state, suggesting flood or drawdown events."
