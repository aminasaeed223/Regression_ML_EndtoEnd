  "trend_summary": "1990s-2020s imagery shows a suburban valley gradually intensifying: new warehouses cluster along the north-western industrial park, residential infill fills vacant lots, and a highway interchange is upgraded. Tree cover is moderately reduced around new buildings, while riparian green corridors remain intact. Overall footprint expands slightly yet remains medium-density suburban.",
