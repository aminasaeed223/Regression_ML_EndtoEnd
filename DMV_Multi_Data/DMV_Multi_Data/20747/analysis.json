  "trend_summary": "The area transitions from patchy development to a more continuous suburban fabric. Cul-de-sac housing fills vacant parcels, and light-industrial/commercial roofs cluster along the highway corridor. Open fields shrink, some riparian greening appears, and overall built-up footprint grows yet stays low-rise. Net result: moderate densification within a clearly suburban setting.",

    "New industrial/warehouse blocks erected on the north-eastern edge, replacing open ground.",
    "Cul-de-sac residential subdivisions infill central and south-western wooded parcels.",
    "Commercial strip along the main east–west arterial broadens with larger roofs and parking lots.",
    "Forest and field cover contract, while narrow riparian greenways gain tree planting."
