  "trend_summary": "Satellite series shows steady infill within the central institutional campus: new large-roof buildings, parking decks and sports courts replace lawns and small lots. Peripheral single-family neighbourhoods remain largely intact, while riparian forest and golf-course greenery persist. Road grid unchanged except widened arterial at north. Overall built footprint grows moderately; tree canopy slightly thins near new blocks.",
