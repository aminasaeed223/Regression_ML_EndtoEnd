  "trend_summary": "Across the time-series the landscape remains dominantly rural, alternating between cropland and forest. Built-up footprints grow only marginally along main roads and village cores, keeping overall settlement sparse. Forest regrowth slightly enlarges wooded blocks in the north-east, while several fields consolidate into larger, paler parcels, hinting at intensified agriculture.",
