  "trend_summary": "2000-2020 imagery shows scattered houses giving way to expanding subdivisions. Curvilinear streets spread from the centre, eating into fields and woodland, while a quarry area is partly revegetated. Agriculture retreats, tree cover becomes fragmented, but heavy industry remains limited. Net result is a modest rise in built-up footprint, keeping an overall low-rise suburban character.",
