  "trend_summary": "Across the scenes, farmland remains dominant. Forest blocks thin in the northwest and east, while fields enlarge and become more regular, indicating agricultural consolidation. Only minor settlement infill occurs along the central road; overall built-up footprint stays small, keeping the area largely rural and low-density.",

  "notable_changes": [
    "Progressive clearing of dark forest patches in the northwest peninsular zone.",
    "Expansion and regularisation of rectangular crop fields, especially in the eastern half.",
    "Slight growth of a linear village/hamlet along the north-south central roadway.",
    "Emergence of a few bright-roof agricultural or industrial sheds on the eastern edge.",
    "Reduced vegetation vigour in later image, suggesting seasonal shift or drier conditions."
