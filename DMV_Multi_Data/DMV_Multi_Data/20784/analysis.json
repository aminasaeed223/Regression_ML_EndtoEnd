  "trend_summary": "Tree-dominated suburbs gradually infill: new housing pockets, small commercial strips and a widened highway emerge, nibbling forest edges. Despite incremental sprawl, revegetation along the river and a rehabilitated quarry offset some loss. Overall, the area retains a medium-density suburban profile with modest but steady development pressure.",
