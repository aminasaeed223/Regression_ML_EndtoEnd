  "trend_summary": "Across the series, the village core slowly expanded along the main road, adding scattered houses and a small subdivision while farmland edges re-greened. Forest cover thickened, riverbanks naturalised, and a modest airstrip gained a longer cleared zone. No large industrial or high-rise growth appeared, keeping the landscape predominantly rural and low-density.",
