  "trend_summary": "Built-up land slowly expanded along the northern riverfront, with new roads and scattered subdivisions pushing southward. Forest cover declined in several interior patches, converted mainly to pasture or cropland. A few isolated clearings appeared in the east, while water margins shifted slightly. Overall change is gradual, keeping the peninsula largely green and low-density.",

    "Incremental spread of housing and streets along the northern shoreline settlement core.",
    "Several forest blocks in the central and southern interior cleared for fields or pasture.",

    "Progressive infill of small lots between existing houses, indicating slow suburbanisation."
