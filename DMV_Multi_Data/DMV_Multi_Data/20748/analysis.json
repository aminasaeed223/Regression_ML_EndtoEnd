  "trend_summary": "Earliest to latest scenes show progressive suburban infill: vacant patches convert to housing, industrial/commercial blocks enlarge near the central corridor, and new interchanges widen the main east-west highway. Tree cover stays extensive, aided by riparian and roadside greening. Overall built footprint climbs steadily, giving the landscape clear medium-density, predominantly suburban character.",
