  "trend_summary": "Images show an already suburban landscape steadily filling remaining gaps. Forest and field pockets shrink as cul-de-sac housing and small commercial strips expand, most visibly in the eastern riverfront and central corridor. Road realignments and roundabouts support growth, while older blocks gain denser tree cover and recreational fields, signalling gradual infill rather than sprawl.",

    "Eastern riverbank woodland cleared and converted to new neighbourhood with sports/utility facilities.",
    "Multiple infill cul-de-sac housing clusters replace small farm or forest parcels in central and western sectors.",
    "Addition and widening of arterial roads; new roundabouts improve internal connectivity.",
    "Progressive reduction of open farmland plots in southwest, replaced by townhouse blocks and parking lots.",
    "Maturing street trees and park plantings increase overall canopy cover in older districts."
