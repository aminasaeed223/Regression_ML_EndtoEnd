  "trend_summary": "Satellite series shows steady infill and commercial expansion. Detached housing fabric remains, but tree cover slowly thins. The rail-corridor east gains large warehouses, residential buildings, parking decks and a stadium-sized facility, while new roads and small retail pads appear along main arteries. Overall footprint grows moderately; densification is localised, keeping a leafy, low-rise suburban character.",
