  "trend_summary": "Across the time series, scattered villages expand marginally, field patterns adjust, and a modest airfield‐industrial strip enlarges. Forest patches are partly cleared for crops, then partially re-greened. Built-up area grows slowly but still occupies little of the territory, so the landscape remains predominantly agricultural and sparsely settled.",
