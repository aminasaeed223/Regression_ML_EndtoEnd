  "trend_summary": "From earliest to latest dates, built surface expanded moderately, mainly around existing settlements. A large housing subdivision emerged on the north-east ridge, while the southern town thickened and spread westward. Forest cover shrank as fields and roads widened, especially near the lake. Overall built-up footprint rose but landscape remains predominantly green, marking a sparsely built suburban zone.",
