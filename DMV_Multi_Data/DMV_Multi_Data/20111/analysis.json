  "trend_summary": "Over the series, suburban settlements spread steadily from the northwest core toward central and southern sectors. Housing estates infill forest and former farmland, while road and highway networks densify. Despite expansion, large green tracts persist, keeping overall medium density. Net trends are outward growth, infill, and gradual vegetation reduction.",
