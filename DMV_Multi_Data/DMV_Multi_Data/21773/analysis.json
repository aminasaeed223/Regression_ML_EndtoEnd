  "trend_summary": "Across the series, a mainly farm-forest mosaic persists. Central cropland expands gradually, and minor linear settlement growth occurs along the southern highway, but built-up footprint stays limited. The most striking change is large-scale forest loss and browning on the southwestern hills in the last image. Overall, the area remains sparsely built and rural.",
