  "trend_summary": "Over the series, low-rise residential subdivisions gradually infill and expand, especially near the eastern highway interchange and south-central sector, trimming contiguous forest. Commercial roofs emerge beside the main east–west road. Water bodies and road hierarchy remain constant, while overall tree cover shrinks slightly, indicating steady suburban maturation rather than rapid urbanization.",
