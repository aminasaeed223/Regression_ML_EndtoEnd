  "trend_summary": "The area remains predominantly low-rise suburbia, but between the earliest and latest scenes it shows steady infill: larger residential lots subdivided, new townhouse clusters, and expansion of warehouse/office parks along the main highway network. Road capacity increases and added interchanges accompany commercial growth while woodland pockets shrink yet some roadside greening matures.",
