  "trend_summary": "Built-up footprint grows steadily, mainly around the airport in the northeast and the town core, while most western hills stay wooded. New highways and interchanges knit districts together, residential infill fills former clearings, and a reservoir enlarges, adding blue space. Overall fabric remains green-buffered, giving a medium-density suburban character.",
