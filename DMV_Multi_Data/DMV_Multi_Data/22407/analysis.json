  "trend_summary": "Built-up footprints spread steadily from central and south-eastern clusters, filling vacant lots and edging outward along new roads. Forest cover increased in north and west as marginal farmland retired. Industrial parcels and large paved complexes appear after mid-series, while a few ponds/reservoirs were enlarged. Overall pattern is medium-density suburban growth with limited high-rise concentration.",
