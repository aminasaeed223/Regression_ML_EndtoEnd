  "trend_summary": "Forest cover gradually fragments as rectangular cropland blocks proliferate, mainly in the east-central sector. A few new farmsteads, silos and minor road widenings appear, but settlements stay dispersed. No major industrial or residential clusters develop; human pressure is limited to agricultural intensification, keeping the landscape fundamentally rural and sparsely built.",
