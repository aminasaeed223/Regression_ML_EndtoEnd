  "trend_summary": "Across the series the highway-anchored suburb thickens: vacant lots and small fields give way to new cul-de-sac housing, a sizable mixed-use block by the western interchange, and extra warehouses along the rail corridor. Road widening and added parking shrink tree cover, yet parks and school grounds persist. Overall form remains mid-rise, car-oriented.",
