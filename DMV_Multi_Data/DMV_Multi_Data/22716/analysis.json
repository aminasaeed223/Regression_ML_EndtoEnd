  "trend_summary": "Across the sequence, small villages expand marginally, cropland consolidates and spreads, and contiguous forest cover retreats—most noticeably in the centre-east and northern ridge. A new north-south corridor appears, likely a road or utility line. Despite these shifts, the landscape stays agriculture-dominated, with low, dispersed settlement and no emergence of dense urban fabric.",
