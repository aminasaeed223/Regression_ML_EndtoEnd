  "trend_summary": "Across the series, the peninsula keeps its residential layout but experiences steady infill: new cul-de-sacs, an expanded shopping plaza and denser tree canopy. Green buffers along the river grow wider, yet no major sprawl beyond the existing footprint occurs. Net result is a stable, medium-density suburban setting with incremental renewal.",
