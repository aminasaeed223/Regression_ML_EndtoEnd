  "trend_summary": "Across the time-series, the territory remained a green, golf-course-anchored suburb, but steady infill replaced scattered woodland pockets with housing and small commercial plazas. Road corridors widened, especially the north freeway interchange, and parking expanses enlarged. Overall fabric shifted from leafy sprawl toward closer-packed lots without reaching true urban density.",
