  "trend_summary": "Built-up areas remain small and clustered around the central township, spreading slightly south and north along the main highway. Farmland parcels consolidate, while some forest on the western slopes alternates between regrowth and a recent large brown scar, hinting at logging or fire. Transport corridors appear upgraded, and a new pond emerges northeast.",
