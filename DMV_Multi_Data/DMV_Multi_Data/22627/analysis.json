  "trend_summary": "Across the sequence the area remains dominantly agricultural–forest terrain. Built forms stay scattered and limited to small villages; only minor edge-growth and a few new farm complexes appear. Some woodland on the western hills is cleared then partly regenerated, while eastern fields become more regular. Overall change is modest with no major urbanisation.",
