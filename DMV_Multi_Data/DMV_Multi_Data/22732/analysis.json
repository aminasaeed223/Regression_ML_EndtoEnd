  "trend_summary": "Across the five dates the landscape stays predominantly rural and wooded. Limited tree clearing enlarges pasture in the north and east, while scattered single-lot houses line existing roads. A few fields are left fallow and begin reforestation, balancing losses. Built-up footprint grows only marginally; no industrial or dense urbanisation appears.",
