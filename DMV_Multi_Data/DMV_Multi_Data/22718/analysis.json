  "trend_summary": "The area remains dominantly rural. Built-up cover is limited to scattered farmsteads and a small northern settlement that grows slightly. Forestry harvest–regrowth cycles and field consolidation drive most change, while a modest runway/apron extension appears at the north-west airfield. Overall, land-use stays low-density with minor infrastructure growth.",

  "notable_changes": [
    "Runway and apron lengthened and new service buildings added at the north-west airfield.",
    "Several forest blocks in the south and east are felled and later show regrowth, indicating cyclical timber harvesting.",
    "Central and western cropland parcels merge into larger fields, reducing hedgerow density.",
    "Minor residential infill around the northern village, but no new large settlements.",
    "Small water-retention ponds appear near agricultural tracts, possibly for irrigation or livestock."
