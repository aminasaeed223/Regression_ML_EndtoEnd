  "trend_summary": "Across the series, forest-dominated terrain gradually gives way to more patchy farmland and a modestly enlarging town at the north-east tip. Linear road and utility corridors extend, and scattered forestry clear-cuts appear, some later showing partial regrowth. Built-up surfaces grow slowly, so the landscape remains chiefly rural and green.",
