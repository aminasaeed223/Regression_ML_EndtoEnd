  "trend_summary": "The peninsula evolves from partly cleared woodland with scattered dwellings to a fully built-out waterfront suburb. Central earthworks give way to a finished street grid, clusters of detached houses and cul-de-sacs. Shoreline dock space lengthens, raising impervious cover. After construction, vegetation rebounds around lots, but overall built surface and marina infrastructure steadily increase.",
