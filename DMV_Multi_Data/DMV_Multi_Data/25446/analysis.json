  "trend_summary": "Across the sequence, the peninsula stays predominantly agricultural. Built-up footprints expand only slightly around the central village/industrial node and along a few roads. Field patterns shift with crop rotation, while several plots revert to woodland or pasture. Infrastructure improvements are minor, so the overall character remains sparsely developed and rural.",
