  "trend_summary": "Across the sequence the territory remains predominantly agricultural with scattered villages. Built-up footprints enlarge slowly along main roads, but cropland still dominates. Some forest blocks shrink, replaced by fields, while minor new woodlots appear elsewhere. Road connectivity improves slightly; overall land use shifts are modest, keeping the landscape largely rural and low-density.",
