  "trend_summary": "Across the time series, forested terrain is progressively replaced by curvilinear housing estates and an enlarging industrial/commercial cluster to the east. Highways and collectors are extended, enabling west-ward infill. Though a few cleared sites later greened over, net tree cover falls and the built footprint nearly doubles, yielding medium-density suburbia.",

    "Curvy residential subdivisions spread north-west and south-west, occupying former forest.",
    "Eastern industrial/commercial zone grows southward with larger rooftops and parking.",
    "New/expanded arterial road bisects the area, linking developments and spurring infill.",
    "Overall vegetation cover declines; isolated re-greening seen on a few cleared lots.",
    "Scattered infill housing increases density inside earlier neighbourhood envelopes."
