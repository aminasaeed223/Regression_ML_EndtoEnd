  "trend_summary": "Across the series the built-up footprint steadily widens from the central highway corridor. Warehouses and medium-lot housing push east and south, replacing fields, while scattered infill fills gaps west of the interchange. Road capacity and ramps are upgraded, fragmenting green space. Growth is gradual but persistent, leaving a mainly medium-density suburban fabric.",
