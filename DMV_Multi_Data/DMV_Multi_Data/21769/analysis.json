  "trend_summary": "The eastern town edges outwards, adding low-rise housing and a few industrial sheds. Forest cover expands over scattered fields, especially west and centre, though the latest image shows drought-related browning there. Cultivated patchwork persists but contracts slightly. Road layout is largely stable. Net change: modest settlement growth within an otherwise farm-and-woodland rural landscape.",
