  "trend_summary": "2000-2020 imagery shows a mainly forested island that slowly gives way to more fields and scattered housing. Western farmland enlarges, and small subdivisions spread along the central highway, yet tree cover still dominates. Built-up growth is incremental, without high-rise cores, keeping the landscape essentially rural and low-density.",
