  "trend_summary": "Built-up land grew steadily decade on decade, filling forest clearings and former farmland, especially along the main highway axis and in the east. Expansion is mainly low-rise housing and retail, so the landscape stays suburban; the western floodplain remains largely green. Road density and commercial roofs increased, while several riparian strips show fresh vegetation after channel works.",
