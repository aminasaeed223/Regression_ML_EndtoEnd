  "trend_summary": "Across the series, the landscape stays dominantly rural. Forest blocks contract slightly as rectangular crop fields expand, especially west of the central north-south ridge. Built-up footprints remain scattered, with only modest infill near the highway interchange. No large industrial or residential estates emerge; agriculture and woodland exchange area seasonally but pattern is stable.",
