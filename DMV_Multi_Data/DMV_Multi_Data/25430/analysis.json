  "trend_summary": "Across the series, dispersed villages and farmsteads grow modestly, with new housing clusters and sheds at crossroads. A curved bypass appears in the north-east, and minor roads are widened. Farmland still dominates, though small patches turn to woodland or pasture. Change is gradual; the landscape remains largely rural and low-density.",
