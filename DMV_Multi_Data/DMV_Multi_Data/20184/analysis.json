  "trend_summary": "The landscape stays mainly agricultural. Built-up growth is modest, adding houses around the main crossroads and along the east-west road, but no sizable town forms. Northern hill forest is first reduced, then partially replanted. Fields become larger and more regular, reflecting farm consolidation, and a minor new road link appears.",
