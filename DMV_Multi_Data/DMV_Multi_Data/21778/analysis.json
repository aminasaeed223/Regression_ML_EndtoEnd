  "trend_summary": "Across the four dates the landscape remains overwhelmingly agricultural, with only small villages and farmsteads. Field patterns become slightly larger and straighter, a few hamlets expand outward, and roadside ribbon building grows modestly. New minor roads and scattered industrial-farm sheds appear, while woodland patches fluctuate but stay secondary. Overall character stays rural with sparse built-up fabric.",
