  "trend_summary": "Across the series, cropland expands westward early on, while forestry clear-cuts migrate east and central. Later frames show partial reforestation of abandoned plots, but no noticeable increase in settlement. Built-up footprints stay tiny; land use oscillates mainly between agriculture and timber harvest.",
