  "trend_summary": "Built-up cover expands steadily but moderately, driven by new curvilinear housing tracts and roadside commercial pads. Growth radiates west and southwest, nibbling at forest and pasture, while older neighbourhoods show incremental infill. Wooded zones still dominate large swaths, so overall character remains low-rise suburban despite higher roof density along main corridors.",

  "notable_changes": [
    "Several new residential subdivisions appear in the west–central sector, replacing forest and fields.",
    "Arterial road network is extended and loop roads are added, improving east–west connectivity.",
    "Small commercial parcels and parking lots emerge along the southeastern highway interchange.",
    "Patchy reduction of farmland in the northwest as land reverts to either woodland or housing.",
    "Visible infill within older neighbourhoods slightly increases roof density without altering street patterns."
