  "trend_summary": "Imagery reveals steady 30-year shift from mixed forest-farmland to suburbia. West-side subdivisions infilled, while new housing and light-industry push east and south along the highway, replacing many fields. Road upgrades and roundabouts appear, commercial roofs cluster near the northern interchange. Tree cover thins slightly but green corridors persist. Overall medium-density suburban landscape.",
