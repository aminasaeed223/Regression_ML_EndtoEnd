  "trend_summary": "Built-up footprint grows gradually, concentrating north and along the west highway corridor. Industrial estates spread south-west, while new housing clusters fill southern townships. Farmland parcels rearrange; some fields convert to woodland, others to construction. Transport links are upgraded, adding junctions and widening the main artery. Overall, moderate growth keeps the landscape predominantly suburban with medium density.",
