  "trend_summary": "Across the time-series the village core along the east-west road stays intact while only a handful of new houses and one red-roofed commercial block appear. Surrounding land remains mostly agricultural; fields cycle through pasture, plough and regrowth. A new pond emerges north-west and endures. Built-up growth is limited and dispersed.",
