  "trend_summary": "From earliest to latest images, the suburban zone shows steady infill. Small vacant lots become housing, warehouse blocks expand near the highway interchange, and several new parking areas appear. Road layout is largely unchanged, while tree cover slightly rises as street-side planting matures. Overall, growth is modest, keeping a green, medium-density suburban character.",
