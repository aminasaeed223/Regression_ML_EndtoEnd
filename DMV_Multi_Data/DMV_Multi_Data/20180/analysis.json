  "trend_summary": "Across the series, a largely agricultural landscape remains. The central town and several roadside villages creep outward, but built-up land stays limited. Field parcels consolidate for intensive farming, while western highlands and riparian strips gain new woodland. Infrastructure is stable, so overall character shifts only slightly toward more organised farming and modest settlement growth.",

    "Central town enlarges south- and east-ward with new housing estates.",
    "Small hamlets infill along primary roads, adding scattered dwellings.",
    "Field boundaries merge, creating larger rectangular plots for mechanised farming.",
    "Woodland blocks expand on western hills and along streams, indicating reforestation or conservation.",
    "A short bypass/connector road appears around the main town, though road network otherwise stable."
