  "trend_summary": "Across the series, housing and small-lot commerce crept outward from the eastern corridor, raising impervious cover slightly. The western sector swung from intact woodland to partial clearance, brief regrowth, then heavier clearing, indicating fluctuating forest management. Industrial blocks densified near the central junction, while the long runway strip stayed largely unchanged.",

    "Creation or reshaping of small ponds/wetlands within the forest gap",
    "Long runway/straight strip remains constant, suggesting conserved transport use"
