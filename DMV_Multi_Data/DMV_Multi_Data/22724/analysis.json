  "trend_summary": "Over the series, the mainly rural landscape shows steady cropland enlargement, especially east and south, at the expense of contiguous forest blocks. The central township spreads slightly outward and infills along the main northeast-southwest roadway, yet overall built footprint stays low. Forest patches thin but remain dominant; few new facilities emerge in the southeast.",
