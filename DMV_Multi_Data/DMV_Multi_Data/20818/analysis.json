  "trend_summary": "Across the sequence, the wooded suburb stays largely intact; only a handful of new houses and small commercial roofs appear, keeping overall built form sparse. The most dynamic feature is the river: alternating clear, vegetated, and muddy flood states signal repeated inundation and wetland growth. Highway and street patterns remain fixed, tree canopy slightly increases.",

    "Intermittent brown-water flood episode covers much of the river corridor in one image.",
    "Progressive spread of emergent vegetation and wetlands along the riverbanks.",
    "Several new single-family rooftops and small outbuildings infill gaps near the central road.",
    "Minor widening or resurfacing visible on the southwest highway interchange.",
    "Selective tree clearing for larger yards, balanced by overall canopy thickening elsewhere."
