  "trend_summary": "2000s imagery shows a compact riverside town. From mid-2000s onward, curvilinear subdivisions sprawl across the northwest plateau and small pockets east of the centre. Forest and cropland give way to housing and some highway-side commercial pads, yet large green tracts persist. Net effect: gradual, moderate infill and edge growth without high-rise intensification.",

    "North-west hilltop cleared and built into a large curvilinear housing subdivision.",
    "Secondary subdivision added east of the historic centre, extending toward the highway.",
    "Wooded strips along the river partly cleared for small industrial or storage yards.",
    "Highway frontage gains several new commercial/parking footprints near the bridge junction.",
    "Multiple cropland parcels converted to residential lots, reducing open farmland."
