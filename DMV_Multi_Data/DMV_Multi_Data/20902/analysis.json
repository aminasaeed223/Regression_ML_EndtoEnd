  "trend_summary": "1990-2020 imagery shows steady suburban infill. Central commercial core retains footprint while parking lots intensify. New cul-de-sac housing pushes tree line outward, especially north-east and south. Arterial roads widened; several retail boxes and school campuses appear. Forested blocks shrink but riparian green ribbons remain, with some newer parks offsetting loss.",
