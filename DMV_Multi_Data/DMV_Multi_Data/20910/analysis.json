  "trend_summary": "Across the time-series the city core retains its compact form while surrounding woodland is slowly replaced by new suburbs and light-industrial parks. Built-up footprint grows moderately along the highway and in the west, indicating steady but not explosive growth. Downtown roofs become larger and denser, yet extensive tree cover keeps overall character semi-suburban.",
