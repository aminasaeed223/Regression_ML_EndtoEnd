  "trend_summary": "2000-2020 imagery shows a quarry-fringed township maturing into a cohesive suburb. Excavation land in the north is gradually reclaimed by planned housing, roads and small parks. Farmland patches shrink, replaced by residential blocks and light industry, while forest belts largely persist. Road upgrades accompany growth, yet green corridors still frame development, yielding an overall medium-density suburban landscape.",

    "Former sand-quarry in the northwest is progressively infilled and converted to a gridded housing estate.",
    "Steady eastward and central infill of detached and row housing reduces open farmland plots.",
    "New collector roads, roundabouts and highway slip-roads appear, improving regional connectivity.",
    "Light industrial/commercial expansion near the southern motorway interchange enlarges grey-roofed clusters.",
    "Increase in tree cover and pocket parks within new estates preserves green corridors despite growth."
