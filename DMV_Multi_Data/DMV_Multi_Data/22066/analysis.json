  "trend_summary": "Across the series, a largely wooded county shows slow but steady suburbanisation. New residential subdivisions and commercial strips appear along primary roads, infill increases around existing town centres, and several small farm fields convert to housing. Forest cover slightly rebounds on marginal land, while transport corridors widen. Overall change is incremental, not transformative.",
