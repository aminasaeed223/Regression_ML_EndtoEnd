  "trend_summary": "1990-2020 imagery shows steady forest clearance giving way to dispersed cropland and pasture. Agricultural mosaics spread outward from river bends and along new roads, while hamlets enlarged only marginally. Built-up surfaces remain scarce; landscape stays dominantly rural and vegetated despite accelerating deforestation.",

    "Forest cover shrank markedly, especially along the central east–west corridor and meandering river terraces.",
