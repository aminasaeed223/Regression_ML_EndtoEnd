  "trend_summary": "Across the time‐series the landscape remains dominantly wooded and agricultural. Small clusters of houses lengthen along existing roads, several new clearings appear, and farm fields shift position, but there is no contiguous urban core. Forest cover slowly recedes in scattered patches, balanced by minor regrowth elsewhere. Overall character stays rural with very low built-up intensity.",
