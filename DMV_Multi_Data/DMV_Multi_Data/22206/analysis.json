  "trend_summary": "Across the time series the highway corridor attracted steady warehouse and retail infill, replacing several wooded parcels and enlarging parking lots. Residential blocks stayed mostly unchanged, though a few vacant lots filled with single-family homes. Road widening and new roundabouts improved access. Tree cover shrank modestly, yet golf course and major green buffers persisted.",
