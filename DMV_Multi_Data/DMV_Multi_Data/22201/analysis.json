  "trend_summary": "From earliest to latest image, the small city intensifies rather than expands. Downtown blocks steadily fill vacant lots, parking and low-rise structures are replaced by larger mid-rise complexes, especially along the east-west spine and riverfront. Outlying residential grid and green belts remain largely unchanged, preserving tree cover. Overall built-up density rises but setting stays compact urban.",

    "Downtown infill converts surface parking and gaps into continuous building fabric.",
    "Multiple mid-rise structures appear west of the stadium and along the central corridor.",
    "Riverfront northeast redeveloped with new commercial/academic blocks replacing vegetation.",
    "Incremental road realignments and lot consolidation support higher plot utilisation.",
    "Slight tree-canopy loss in core, while peripheral neighbourhood greenery remains stable."
