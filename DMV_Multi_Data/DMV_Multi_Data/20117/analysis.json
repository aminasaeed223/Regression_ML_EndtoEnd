  "trend_summary": "Across the sequence the landscape stays predominantly agricultural with scattered villages. Built-up footprints enlarge only marginally around road junctions, while several fields are merged and hedgerows removed. Woodland blocks thicken, especially in the north-east, and a curving new distributor road appears south-central. Overall, change is modest and the area remains sparsely developed and rural.",
