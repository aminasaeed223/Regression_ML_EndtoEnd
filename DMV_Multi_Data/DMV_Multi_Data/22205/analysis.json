  "trend_summary": "Throughout the series, the area keeps its low-rise suburban pattern but shows steady infill. New houses, small retail blocks and parking appear along the main east-west arterial, while a few former industrial lots are replaced by commercial or residential uses. Tree cover thickens overall, reflecting street-tree growth and local greening programs.",
